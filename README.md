## employee management system rust and rusqlite
This application was written in rust programming language with rusqlite as the database. Rusqlite is a sqlite wrapper written in rust. The application is a management system for employees. It is a minimal application with just two functionalities - ie. creating new employee and view all the employees. It is a learning project of the rust language and I have no intention to deployed it to production. Code reviews and suggestions are highly welcome. I am new to programming in general.

Thank you very much for your time for looking into this code and making suggestions.

Regards,

Bye!
